# llmatrix
Generate immutable matrices using the C language and linked lists.

llmatrix is simply 'linked list matrix'. These matrices are generated only using linked lists, no arrays used in active code. These matrices are currently immutable, and any attempt to change the values will result in segmentation faults.
